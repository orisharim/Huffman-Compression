# Huffman-Compression
An implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm in c 
## Compiling 
Before compiling make sure all of the files are in the same directory.

In order to compile you can use the gcc command in the terminal on the huffman.c file.
 ```md
 gcc -Wall huffman.c
  ```
## Executing
Now use the new file of compiled code that was created by gcc.

 ```md
 ./a.out -c/-d fileName
  ```

| argument | action    |
|---------:|-----------|
|        -c| compress  |
|        -d| decompress(extract)|

## Explanation
You got a presentation that explains the algorithm and how everything is working, just open the huffman compression.pdf/pptx file.
